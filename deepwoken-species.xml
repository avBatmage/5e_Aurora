            <p>Ganymedes and Vesperians share the same ancestors. A long time ago, before the Cantaclysm, both Vesperians and Ganymedes were part of the same race: Hivekin. With the rising of the Tides, they were forced to split apart, what would later be known as the Vesperians stayed with the Greathive to attempt to outgrow the Tides, meanwhile what would later be known as the Ganymedes took their travels deep below, into Scyphozia. Because of this, Ganymedes evolved to no longer need their Vesperian masks, and their skin gradually became darker as they no longer needed such dry skin, nowadays being either black or blackened purple, and their hair color is usually white, silver, or some shade of purple. </p>
            <p>Most of today's Ganymedes have changed eyes, but some rare ones are still seen with semi-normal eye shapes. To see better in Scyphozia, Ganymedes' eye shape had completely changed to nothing but two symbols, or runes of sorts. Their eyes might be a cross, a ring, a diamond, a swirl, etc.</p>

            <p>Vesperians share many traits with beetles, and inhabit the Greathive. Their ancestors, the Hivekin, developed Lifeweave and created the Greathive. Since the Cantaclysm, the Hivekin race was split into two: The Ganymedes, who ventured into Scyphozia to face tragedy head-on, and the Vesperians, who stayed at the Greathive and stuck to the idea that they could use Lifeweave to grow the Greathive faster than the Tides could sink it. Vesperians are never seen without their masks, and have used Lifewegve to evolve their bodies to be stronger and more durable.</p>
            <p>They usually have either dark green or dark, desaturated brown skin, and dark green or black hair.</p>
